## About me: 
Hello! I am a university student from Korea who loves basketball and working out. 
I am particularly interested in autonomous driving, and my dream is to become a researcher who contributes to a safer world through autonomous driving technology. 
To achieve this, I have served as the president of my university club, Kookmin Automotive Artificial Intelligence (KaAI), where I led various projects. 
I am eager to learn and grow through the SEA:ME program.
